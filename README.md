# ServiceCatalogPortfolio02DevOps
Builds an AWS Service Catalog portfolio for DevOps products such as ECS Clusters, ECR registries and Service/Tasks.

There is not much to set up here, just customize your parameters for the stack and run in on AWS CloudFormation.

## Notes

Remember the output of this stack is used as input for product templates.

## Change log
2022-04-05 > Well, we could go ahead and set up a pipeline to run Portfolio updates whenever there is a change in the repository. I'll try this later.
